# Iris Flower Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The **Iris Flower Classification** project is a machine learning application that classifies iris flowers into one of three species: **Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica, and Iris Versicolor**. The dataset used is the famous **Iris Flower Data Set**, introduced by **Ronald Fisher** in 1936. It consists of **150 samples**, with **four features** measured for each flower:

- **Sepal Length (cm)**
- **Sepal Width (cm)**
- **Petal Length (cm)**
- **Petal Width (cm)**

The goal of this project is to apply **machine learning algorithms** to classify iris flowers based on these features.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- The dataset can be found on **Kaggle**: [Iris Flower Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)
- It contains **150 records** distributed equally across three species.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, KNN, Random Forest)

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization using **Seaborn & Matplotlib**
- Distribution analysis of features
- Pair plots and correlation heatmaps

## ðŸš€ Model Training & Evaluation
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values (if any), feature scaling, and encoding.
- Model Training: Comparing multiple ML models.
- Performance Metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix**.

## ðŸ“œ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
